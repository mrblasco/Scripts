<p>Run a command only if another command returns a zero exit status Use the &amp;&amp; control operator to combine two commands so that the second is run only if the first command returns a zero exit status. In other words, if the first command runs successfully, the second command runs. If the first command fails, the second command does not run at all. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Using national survey on workers motivations, it shows that more than 80% of workers say they will likely work even under no monitoring from superiors instead of shirking as predicted by economic theory. <em>One concern:</em> social desirability bias (respondents want to draw a favorable picture of themselves). <em>One possible solution:</em> ask the same sets of questions but related to someone else in the same firm, such as a colleague or someone with whom they interact frequently.</p>

<h1 id="gender-quota-in-a-matching-markets-are-there-otherbetter-systems">Gender quota in a matching markets: are there other/better systems?</h1>
<p>Organizations have often “quota” that must be met while hiring new members (schools, universities, government, firms, etc.). In a matching market, imposing a quota is equivalent to operate a change in the preferences of the hiring agents.Wondering whether there is a better way to affect the preferences without harming too much the equilibrium of the market. For example, a quota may introduce non-convexities in the preferences that may harm the efficiency of the market. An alternative could be to impose additional costs/discounts in hiring certain types. Another possibility in a market with N organizations competing (such as universities and students) is to create a collective requirement for all the organizations.</p>
<h1 id="nber-data-projects">NBER data projects</h1>
<p>From 1973 to today, more than 20K abstracts of research papers in economics. How research topics evolved over time? How the economy affected research efforts (think about oil crisis, financial crisis, etc.)? Can we use text analysis to study such evolution? How? Check Margaret Roberts papers on text analysis with covariates.</p>
<p>Data about aknowledgements in research papers</p>
<ul>
<li>Alex Oettl should have a paper on this topic (helpers vs non-helpers)</li>
<li>One research question culd be the importance of authors on “diffusion” (citation count) controlling for quality (journal pubblication)</li>
<li>An alternative is the role of social connections</li>
</ul>
<p>Topic modeling as a measure of novelty</p>
<ul>
<li>Combinatorial topics</li>
<li>Jian is working on this</li>
</ul>
<p>Often empirical works on novelty estimate effects on citations of a single paper. However, individual gains from a novel paper do not stop from the first paper. It could be that the first paper does not get many citations but it allows to exploit the new field in a stream of papers.</p>
<p>Empirically: if a new combination appears how long does it persist? Is this taken by other people?</p>
<h1 id="ben-enkes-work-on-beliefs-in-networks">Ben Enke’s work on beliefs in networks</h1>
<p>“What you see is all there is” nails down the experimental design to understand how people form beliefs in networks.</p>
<p>Computer players + self-selection into two groups and ask human players (acting individually) to make a prediction about a number.</p>
<p>Some people correctly discount the underlying correlation in signals and make the right prediction, others focus on what they observe disregarding the correlations.</p>
<p>He further uses individual data to try to explain what causes the difference.</p>
